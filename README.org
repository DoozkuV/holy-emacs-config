* Holy Emacs Config
Hello! This is a base setup for a new emacs configuration that I am
working on based off of my previous configuration. However, I have
decided to purge this config from all that is evil. The standard Emacs
bindings are actually quite nice - and I find them much more
convenient than constantly having to switch between different modes in
Vim. Plus, this config is much smaller and more minimal than any
configuration using Evil - which is amazing for performance and
startup speed!
